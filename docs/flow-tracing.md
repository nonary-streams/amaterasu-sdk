# Flow tracing

Flow tracing answers one question: when an input event or a video frame was
slow, which step took the time, and what was the host doing meanwhile.

The earlier [latency diagnostics](streaming-latency-diagnostics.md) report each
module's own stages as ten-second aggregates. They show that something was slow
somewhere. They cannot follow one event across module boundaries, and the
host-thread report blames whichever module made the last broker call. Flow
tracing follows the item itself and times each module call directly.

## The model

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Track | A family of flows, named once: `input`, `video`. |
| Flow | One traced item: one control message, one frame. A 64-bit identity both sides of a boundary derive from data they already exchange. |
| Stage | A point a flow reaches: `socket.arrived`, `session.dequeued`. |
| Step | The time between two consecutive stages of one flow. |
| Span | Work that occupied one thread: a module tick, a batch injection. An optional label says what it worked on. |

Each module marks only the stages it owns. The runtime joins the marks into
flows, keeps statistics for every step, and reports a flow that exceeds its
budget together with the spans that overlapped its slowest step. A report names
the step and the module that held the thread:

```json
{"event":"slow_flow","track":"input","total_us":23412,"budget_us":8000,
 "steps":[{"from":"socket.arrived","to":"control.authenticated","us":19810,"by":"amaterasu.control-transport"},
          {"from":"control.authenticated","to":"session.dequeued","us":3320,"by":"amaterasu.stream-session"},
          {"from":"session.dequeued","to":"session.submitted","us":12,"by":"amaterasu.stream-session"},
          {"from":"session.submitted","to":"input.accepted","us":270,"by":"amaterasu.stream-session"}],
 "slowest_step":{"from":"socket.arrived","to":"control.authenticated","us":19810,"percent":84,
   "during":[{"span":"host.tick","label":"amaterasu.state","us":21438,"overlap_us":19600}]}}
```

## What it costs

Recording one observation is one clock read and one push into a lock-free
queue: 62 ns on the producer in a release build
(`cargo test --release -p amaterasu-runtime recording_cost -- --ignored --nocapture`).
Nothing is formatted, allocated, locked or logged on the producer's thread.
Joining, statistics and reports run on the runtime's own `amaterasu-trace`
thread, which starts when the first module binds a sink and sleeps between
drains.

Every structure is bounded. A full queue drops observations and reports the
count in the next window; it never blocks a producer. A tracer without a sink is
one branch, so a module needs no fallback path for an older runtime.

## Recording from a module

```rust
use amaterasu_module_sdk::trace::{Stage, Tracer, Track, flow_id, names};

struct PacketTrace { tracer: Tracer, track: Track, read: Stage, admitted: Stage }

// Once, at start. Names are interned on this cold path.
let tracer = Tracer::bind(&runtime);
let trace = PacketTrace {
    track: tracer.track(names::VIDEO_TRACK),
    read: tracer.stage(names::SESSION_PACKET_READ),
    admitted: tracer.stage(names::TRANSPORT_ADMITTED),
    tracer,
};

// On the hot path. The video pipeline started this flow with the same identity.
let flow = flow_id(video_stream, packet.sequence);
trace.tracer.mark(trace.track, flow, trace.read);
// ...
trace.tracer.finish(trace.track, flow, trace.admitted, Duration::from_millis(12));
```

- A flow starts at its first mark and ends at `finish`. The module that ends a
  flow supplies the budget: the first-to-last time at which the flow is reported
  individually.
- `mark_at` records a stage that happened earlier, such as a datagram's kernel
  arrival: `tracer.now().earlier_by(kernel_residence)`. All timestamps use the
  sink's clock, so modules never compare clocks of their own.
- `mark_with` attaches one number worth seeing next to a slow step, such as a
  batch size. Never record user data, key values or coordinates.
- `span` returns a guard that records the work's duration when dropped;
  `record_span` records a duration measured some other way.
- `discard` forgets a flow that turned out not to belong to its track, such as
  a control message that carried no input. It leaves no statistics and no report.
- A flow that never reaches `finish` or `discard` is counted as abandoned after
  five seconds. End flows you start, including the paths that drop an item.

`Tracer` is `Copy`, `Send` and `Sync`. Keep the handles in the struct that does
the work; no global or macro is involved.

### Sharing a flow across modules

`flow_id(scope, sequence)` gives independently built modules the same identity
without a new field on any ABI. `scope` is a handle both already know, and
`sequence` the item's number within it:

| Track | Scope | Sequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | the control stream handle | the authenticated message sequence |
| `video` | the video stream handle | the frame sequence carried by `EncodedPacket` |

Stage and track names in `trace::names` are the contract between modules. A
provider that replaces a built-in one joins the same flows by using the same
names and identity. A provider that records nothing leaves a gap in the steps,
not a broken trace: the step simply spans from the last stage before it to the
first one after.

### Current stages

| Track | Stage | Recorded by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input` | `socket.arrived`, `control.authenticated` | control transport |
| `input` | `session.dequeued`, `session.submitted`, `input.accepted` | stream session |
| `input` | `session.coalesced` (a newer sample replaced this one) | stream session |
| `video` | `video.capture_started`, `video.encoder_submitted`, `video.packet_queued` | video |
| `video` | `session.packet_read`, `transport.admitted` | stream session |

| Span | Label | Recorded by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `host.pass` | — | host: one complete round of module ticks |
| `host.tick`, `host.health` | module identity | host: calls of at least 0.25 ms |
| `host.wait` | — | host: idle waits of at least 0.5 ms |
| `input.batch` | `direct` or `queued` | input |

The video pipeline starts each frame's flow and the consumer ends it. A consumer
that records nothing leaves those flows to be counted as abandoned, so a
replacement consumer of the video service should mark `transport.admitted` or
its own final stage.

The control transport starts a flow for every authenticated message. The
session discards the ones that carry no input: pings, IDR requests, and input
rejected because the stream is not active.

`socket.arrived` is the oldest datagram a control stream read in the tick that
completed the message, which is the longest the message can have waited.
`input.accepted` is the input provider's acknowledgement. Host tracing ends
there: the game's consumption of the event, the network and the client are
outside it.

## Reports

All reports reach the host log under `amaterasu.runtime`:

| Target | When | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trace.slow_flow` | a flow reached its budget | every step, the slowest one, the spans during it |
| `trace.slow_span` | a span lasted 8 ms or more | the span, its label and its recorder |
| `trace.window` | every ten seconds with activity | per track: completed, slow and abandoned flows, the budget, total and per-step timing; the spans with the most time |

The default log holds only what a person would notice: a flow or span at least
twice over its limit. A flow or span nearer its limit is routine on a busy
host, and a window is written whatever happened, so those are debug records
(see [latency diagnostics](streaming-latency-diagnostics.md) for the level).
Every one of them still counts in the report below.

Slow reports are limited to twenty per track and twenty spans per window; the
window states how many were suppressed and the worst one. Percentiles are
histogram upper bounds, as in the other diagnostics.

## The performance report

Management reads recent history with `{"op":"trace_snapshot"}`. The reply is
one compact report, at most 14 KiB, so it fits a broker result and a management
HTTP response with room to spare:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `recent` | the last minute as one summary: each track's flows, budget and steps; the host loop's pass and wait; the sixteen spans that held a thread longest |
| `trend` | half an hour as columns of numbers, one value per ten-second window: each track's worst and 95th percentile, and the longest host pass |
| `slow` | the thirty most recent slow moments, newest first |

Slow reports that share a cause and follow each other within two seconds are
one moment: every input event that waited for the same pause, or every frame of
a minute in which the encoder ran slow. A moment counts its members, keeps the
worst and records when the run began and was last seen. It names the call that
overlapped its slowest step longest, provided that call covered at least half
of the step; a short call that merely happened during a slow step is not
blamed. When a report would exceed its size, the oldest trend points go first,
then the oldest moments, then the shortest spans.

The web UI's Diagnostics page shows the report as the Performance panel through
`/v1/diagnostics/performance`, which requires `diagnostics.read`. Only
management and Diagnostics may read it, because it names every module.

## Contract

`TraceRecord` and `TraceSinkApi` are defined in `amaterasu-abi` and in
[`amaterasu.h`](../sdk/include/amaterasu.h). A module obtains its sink with the
`trace_bind` control message; the reply carries the process-local address of a
runtime-owned table that stays valid until the runtime is destroyed. The table
holds no module-supplied pointers, so binding needs no native grant: it carries
the same authority as writing a log record. The runtime attributes each record
to the endpoint that bound the sink; a record cannot name its own producer.

An older runtime rejects `trace_bind`, which leaves tracing disabled. A module
built before tracing never asks. The host binds a sink through its own endpoint
the same way.

`crates/module-sdk/src/trace/tests.rs` runs an unchanged consumer against a
second sink implementation that shares no code with the runtime's.
