//! Flow tracing: record where an input event or a frame spends its time.
//!
//! A *flow* is one traced item, identified by a number both sides of a module
//! boundary can derive from data they already exchange (see [`flow_id`]). Each
//! module marks the stages it owns; the runtime joins the marks, keeps
//! statistics for every step and reports flows that exceed their budget,
//! together with the thread spans that overlapped the slowest step.
//!
//! A *span* is a piece of work that occupied one thread, such as a module tick
//! or an encoder submission. Spans explain why a step was slow.
//!
//! Recording costs one clock read and one lock-free queue push on the calling
//! thread. Nothing is formatted, allocated or logged there. A tracer without a
//! sink (an older runtime, or [`Tracer::disabled`]) is a single branch.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct InputTrace { tracer: Tracer, track: Track, dequeued: Stage, accepted: Stage }
//!
//! let tracer = Tracer::bind(&runtime);
//! let trace = InputTrace {
//!     track: tracer.track(names::INPUT_TRACK),
//!     dequeued: tracer.stage("session.dequeued"),
//!     accepted: tracer.stage("input.accepted"),
//!     tracer,
//! };
//! let flow = flow_id(control_stream, message_sequence);
//! trace.tracer.mark(trace.track, flow, trace.dequeued);
//! // ... later, when the provider acknowledged the event ...
//! trace.tracer.finish(trace.track, flow, trace.accepted, Duration::from_millis(8));
//! ```
