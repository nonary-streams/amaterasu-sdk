//! Typed events: a module announces that something changed, and any module
//! granted the topic follows along.
//!
//! An event is a notification, not a delivery guarantee. Each subscription
//! has a bounded queue, and a subscriber that falls behind either loses the
//! oldest events or is told there is a gap, as its [`Backlog`] says. Publish
//! a revision or an identifier and let subscribers read the state from its
//! owner; do not publish the state itself and expect every copy to arrive.
//!
//! A [`Topic`] ties a topic name to the payload its publisher sends, so the
//! publisher and its subscribers share one definition:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! pub const LIBRARY_CHANGED: Topic<LibraryChanged> = Topic::new("example.library.changed/1");
//!
//! runtime.publish(&LIBRARY_CHANGED, &LibraryChanged { revision })?;
//!
//! let mut changes = Subscription::open(&runtime, &LIBRARY_CHANGED, Backlog::Latest(1))?;
//! // each tick:
//! while let Some(delivery) = changes.next(&runtime)? { ... }
//! ```
//!
//! The topics the built-in modules publish are defined in [`topics`].
