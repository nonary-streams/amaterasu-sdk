//! Extension points: an owner asks the modules that trusted composition lists
//! for one of its hooks, and decides what to do with their answers.
//!
//! Policy names each hook's owner and its participants, in order. The owner
//! starts a [`HookRun`] and polls it; each participant receives the run as an
//! ordinary request whose [`hook`](crate::requests::IncomingRequest::hook) is
//! set, and replies to it or refuses it.
//!
//! Two choices shape a run:
//!
//! - **Required or best effort.** A required run needs every participant: an
//!   absent, failed or refusing participant stops it, and no later one is
//!   asked. Use it for a decision that must not be made without them. A
//!   [`best_effort`](HookRun::best_effort) run asks every participant and
//!   reports each outcome. Use it for contributions the owner can do without.
//! - **Broadcast or chained.** By default every participant receives the
//!   owner's input, and the owner combines the answers. In a
//!   [`chained`](HookRun::chained) run each participant receives the previous
//!   participant's result and returns the value to pass on, so later
//!   participants build on earlier ones.
//!
//! The broker does not merge or validate answers. The owner checks every
//! contribution, and the final value of a chain, before acting on it.
