 * Offers use resource schemas: resource is writable target capability,
 * acquire_sync is encoder-to-writer, completion_sync is writer-to-encoder.
 * Check exact kind, version, namespace, device, format and sync compatibility;
 * unknown device is not a wildcard. Enumeration and sink calls are synchronous;
 * empty enumeration still has nonzero generation. Offers are borrowed only
 * through the callback.
 *
 * Acquire grants one exclusive lease or BUSY without a lease. Commit success
 * consumes the lease once and queues encoding. Failure schedules no read and
 * leaves ownership with the writer. Abandon consumes the lease only on success
 * and supplies completion for all writer accesses, including pending GPU work.
 * Reject stale, duplicate, wrong-stream and consumed identities. Never reuse
 * storage before all writer and encoder accesses complete; invalid or failed
 * fences require quarantine.
 *
 * Reconfigure stops old acquisitions; old leases can be abandoned, but stale
 * commits fail without consuming them. Successful begin_retirement stops new
 * acquire, configure and commit admission. Existing leases must still be
 * abandoned with completion; an error leaves admission unchanged. No concurrent
 * calls are permitted. Retirement returns PENDING while work or leases remain,
 * RETIRED only when all accesses are proven complete, or QUARANTINED when
 * completion is uncertain. Until RETIRED, pool and encoder bindings, code and
 * all source, device and storage resources remain live until independently
 * proven safe. Process exit ends in-process ownership, but does not prove
 * external GPU, DMA or shared-handle access stopped. Safe termination requires
 * proven completion or platform/driver cleanup guarantees. Timeout or unknown
 * GPU state is not proof. Quarantine may become RETIRED only with actual proof.
 * This protocol does not
 * alter existing synchronous cancel contracts. Callbacks must not unwind. */
