 * host: same provider and authenticated owner, shared session namespace and
 * lifetime; reject foreign/closed IDs. Session ID is the consumer stream ID.
 * Source sessions submit nothing. Existing synchronous cancel is unchanged.
 *
 * probe is side-effect-free and evaluates a candidate before configuration. Its
 * bounded response schema/data describe supported limits and effective format;
 * unknown IDs require negotiation. Session calls are serialized except event
 * callbacks; no unwind crosses the ABI. receive delivers at most one borrowed
 * chunk per call, bounded by max_bytes (1..MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES). Accepted chunks
 * are consumed; rejection preserves the identical chunk. A smaller retry bound
 * returns BUSY without callback; PENDING calls none.

 * stored result; conflicting payload is rejected. POLL uses the original ID
 * and empty data. ACCEPTED/PENDING are not effective; APPLIED/CLAMPED report
 * effective generation and submission boundary. UNSUPPORTED/RECREATE/FAILED/
 * UNKNOWN are distinct outcomes. Sink rejection retains the exact response
 * and never rolls back hardware. Results and replay tombstones survive until
 * session close. A provider advertises lower or equal per-session limits for
 * record count and aggregate request/result/tombstone storage. Before any side
 * effects for a new ID, reserve its complete result and replay record; if either
 * limit would be exceeded, return BUSY without admitting the ID. Same-request
 * retries and POLL remain admitted even at capacity. No eviction may lose exact
 * replay or permit ID reuse; new IDs may remain BUSY until close when full.
 *
 * Event functions are both present or both null; one subscription per session.
 * Subscribe announces existing output/stopped state. Unsubscribe is an
 * idempotent barrier; never call it in a callback. Drain stops admission,
 * completes accepted work and emits exactly one EOS; it is idempotent. Destroy
 * synchronously unsubscribes, cancels submissions and retires work; control
 * service closes the session. If an input pool is used, wait for its RETIRED
 * result before destroy, close or binding release. Pending or quarantined pool
 * resources and bindings remain live until actual retirement proof or exit.
 * Keep service bindings live through these barriers.
 * Release does the same for sessions. No asynchronous retirement is implied. */
